# PeptideCharge
Calculate the net charge of a small peptide or an amino acid sequence

The net-charge of the amino acid or the amino acid sequence at any given pH is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselback equation. 

Usage:
1. Get general info about the amino acid. 
2. Calculate the charge of the amino acid or the net charge of an amino acid sequence.
